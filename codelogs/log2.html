<h1>Code Log 2: CSS Measuring Units</h1>

<h2>Absolute versus Relative Positioning</h2>
<p>When you are looking at an HTML element you wish to move, you may want it on the opposite side of the page or a only a few nudges to the left; either way, you have a some options. 
with absolute posistioning, you are essentially removing the element from the flow within its block. This means that the units you input, which are usually pixel (px) focused, will be 
calculated in relation to the page you see as a whole. If one wishes to keep the element in the flow of its block, the "position: relative;" route is at your disposal. This will keep 
the element in the flow, seen explicitly through the fact that there will be white space in the element's original position. The units you put in will move the element in relation to 
its original placement on the block. 

<h2>Pixels and Points</h2>

<p>Pixels are used in the context of images and text sizing in HTML based sites. Every miniscule dot on our screens is a pixel, but the technical measurement is 1/92nd of an inch.
