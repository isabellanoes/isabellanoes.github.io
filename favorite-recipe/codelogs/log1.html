	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>>

    <p>Semantic codes in HTML are very blatant in their labeling. Their recognizable nature makes them easier to memorize, meaning beginnger sites are generally based in semantics. The placement within an HTML can benefit or hurt one's ranking within a search engine, while also affecting the general user interface experience when a viewer enters. Non-semantic elements do not give insight into the tags' content. These were developed through the advancement of digital layouts, exemplified best in the fact that they only take part in the structure of a page. A drawback is the ability to lessen the accessibility offered by a site.  </p>

    <p>If one knows the algorithmic-manipulation-potential of semantic tagging, they are able to connect with more people. The clear labels make it simple to organize in the process as the coder, which is as important as the user's perception; style and code can be separated with ease.  </p>
